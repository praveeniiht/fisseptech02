1. Create two springboot rest applications called service1 and service2

Name of Application : service1
rest end points
---------------
classlevel Mapping "/service1"
"/test1"   ---  GET --- test1 method of service1 

"/test2"   ---- GET --- test2 method of service1

port: 8082




Name of the Application: service2
rest end points
classlevel mapping: "/service2"

"/test1" ----- GET -- test1 method of service2
"/getTest1"  --- GET -- It should connect to service1 test1 url and display the result.
port : 8083

upload two springboot projects into github and develop two pipe lines

1. for service1 complete devops pipeline should be in the single project.

2. for service2 it should be developed into three diff jobs and make it deploy.

Test the all rest methods fromt the docker runner containers.
